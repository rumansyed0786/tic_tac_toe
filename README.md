# Python project 1: Tic tac toe game
This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in Python. The game is played on a 3x3 grid where two players take turns marking spaces. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

### Installation
To run the game, make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from python.org.

Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/rumansyed0786/tic-tac-toe.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd tic-tac-toe-python

python tic_tac_toe.py

### How to Play
- The game starts by displaying an empty Tic Tac Toe board.
- Players are prompted to enter their moves alternately.
- Players input their move by specifying the row and column they want to mark.
- The game continues until one player wins or the board is full, resulting in a draw.

### Features
- Simple User Interface: The game interface is text-based and easy to understand.
- Two Player Mode: Players can play against each other on the same computer.
- Winning Detection: The game detects winning moves and announces the winner.
- Draw Detection: If no player wins and the board is full, the game announces a draw.

### Project Structure
- tic_tac_toe.py: The main Python script containing the game logic.
- README.md: This file providing information about the project.

### Learning Outcomes
- Python Basics: This project helped reinforce fundamental Python concepts such as functions, conditionals (if, else), and loops.
- Problem-Solving Skills: Implementing the game logic required breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable tasks.
- User Interaction: Learning how to handle user input and provide feedback in a text-based interface.
- Algorithmic Thinking: Developing the winning and draw detection algorithms enhanced algorithmic thinking skills.


### Future Improvements
- AI Opponent: Implement an AI opponent for single-player mode.
- GUI Interface: Create a graphical user interface for a more visually appealing experience.
- Scalability: Allow for variable board sizes to support larger grids.
